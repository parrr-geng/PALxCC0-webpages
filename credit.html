                      <b>Massimiliano Cerioni</b> (Italy 1986) is an award-winning composer and
                      performer, currently living in Berlin. He uses coding and designs musical
                      instruments to explore new sonic possibilities for solo and collaborative
                      projects concerning different forms of artwork, from pure sound
                      compositions to multimedia projects. Cerioni graduated in electronic music
                      at the Casella conservatory with Michelangelo Lupone.
                    </p>

                      <b>Miguel La Corte</b> (B. Caracas, Venezuela, 1999). Miguel’s current
                      practice is focused on instrumenting shared experiences and designing Open
                      Media Ecologies. In more detail, he approaches music as a vehicle for
                      agency through experiences of public collective creation; Shifting the
                      public notion of creation as a closed process into a new conception of
                      creation as an open and collective process.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      In late 2016 Miguel founded myriorama.xyz, a instrument development
                      company originally focused in the restoration and redesign of
                      electroacoustic pianos. On a general level Myriorama is intended to
                      reflect on our shared living circumstances by designing and restoring the
                      instruments and elements that define these spaces.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      As his first prototype of an Open Media Ecology, he founded the
                      Participative Audio Lab in 2022, an organisation focused on the
                      development of open source tools that enable artists open source
                      participative music distribution.

                      <b>Stratos Bichakis</b> (b. 1984) is an interdisciplinary artist and
                      composer. An engineer by education, and member of the Athenian
                      experimental music scene. He has forged his way of creative discovery,
                      operating in the horizon between art and technology, keeping sound as a
                      core element in his practice. He is a member of Contemporary Music
                      Research Center (KSYME-CMRC). He co-founded the creative hub Ubique, in
                      Athens in 2018, and led a series of yearly seminars on experimental music
                      practice. He has presented his work at festivals and exhibitions in
                      Greece, Europe, Russia, and Canada. He is currently based in Berlin.

                      <b>Santiago Burelli</b> (b. 1993 Caracas, Venezuela) is a
                      multidisciplinary artist whose practice spans mediums including
                      documentary filmmaking, sound installation, sculpture, and music. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Regardless of the vehicle, Burelli approaches each project from nuanced
                      political and sociological angles that explore our relationship with
                      materials, space, and sound. By experimenting with industrial construction
                      materials such as concrete, lighting, steel, and electronics, Burelli
                      brings to light our convoluted relationship with industry, extractivism,
                      production, and consumerism.
